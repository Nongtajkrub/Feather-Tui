> A Rust crate for building simple terminal-based user interfaces.

⚠️ **This is my first-ever Rust project** ⚠️  

Feather-Tui is a simple terminal UI library designed to provide building blocks for terminal-based user interfaces. It started life as a small C library aiming to offer an easy-to-use UI framework for terminal applications. Now, I’m rewriting it in Rust to learn the language and (hopefully) improve both performance and maintainability.
