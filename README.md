## About

> A Rust rewrite of the terminal UI library I originally wrote in C for my school management project.

⚠️ **This is my first-ever Rust project — expect some experiments, mistakes, and learning-in-public moments along the way.** ⚠️

---

**Termui** is a **simple terminal UI library** designed to provide building blocks for text-based user interfaces.  
It started life as a small C library in my **school management system project**, aiming to offer an **easy-to-use UI framework** for terminal applications. Now, I’m rewriting it in **Rust** to learn the language and (hopefully) improve both performance and maintainability.

## 📊 Progress

![](https://geps.dev/progress/10)

Termui is still under development. Currently, the following parts are done (or partially done):

✅ **Component** - Basic building blocks  
✅ **Container** - For grouping components  
⏳ **Renderer** - Partially implemented (core rendering functions are in progress)

---

## 💡 Why Rewrite in Rust?

- Better **memory safety** without manual management
- Modern language features like **pattern matching** and **error handling**
- Opportunity to **learn Rust** while working on a real project
