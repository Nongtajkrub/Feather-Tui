# About Termui

> A Rust rewrite of the terminal UI library I originally wrote in C for my school management project.

⚠️ **This is my first-ever Rust project, so expect some learning-in-public moments along the way.** ⚠️

This library provides simple building blocks to create terminal-based user interfaces. It was first created in C as part of a school management project, where the goal was to provide a lightweight and easy-to-use UI system for terminal applications. This version is a complete rewrite in Rust. Will it improve both performance and maintainability? I don't know.

# Progress 
![](https://geps.dev/progress/10)

Termui isn’t fully complete yet — so far, I’ve finished the Component, Container, and part of the Renderer.
