> A Rust rewrite of the terminal UI library I originally wrote in C for my school management project.

⚠️ **This is my first-ever Rust project** ⚠️  


Feather-Tui is a simple terminal UI library designed to provide building blocks for text-based user interfaces. It started life as a small C library in my school management system project, aiming to offer an easy-to-use UI framework for terminal applications. Now, I’m rewriting it in Rust to learn the language and (hopefully) improve both performance and maintainability.
